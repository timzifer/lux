# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.21.3] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **software: Draw() with vertex rasterization + textured blit** — Software backend
  now renders textured quads (fullscreen blit) and vertex-buffer-based triangles via
  `raster.Pipeline`. Resource registry for handle→resource lookup. MSAA resolve in End().
  21 tests.

- **core: entry-by-entry BindGroupLayout compatibility** — Layouts compared by entries,
  not pointer equality, matching WebGPU spec and Rust wgpu-core. 7 tests.

- **core: lazy GLES adapter enumeration with surface hint** — GLES backends defer
  adapter enumeration until `RequestAdapter` with `CompatibleSurface`. OpenGL requires
  GL context which only exists after surface creation.

- **RequestAdapterOptions** — Proper struct with `CompatibleSurface *Surface` field
  (was alias to gputypes). Follows WebGPU spec `requestAdapter({compatibleSurface})`.

### Fixed

- **DX12: reduce CBV/SRV/UAV heap to 1M** — D3D12 Tier 1/2 spec maximum. Was 1,048,576.
  Fixes `E_INVALIDARG` on NVIDIA. ([wgpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/issues/106))

- **GLES: nil context guard in Adapter.Open** — Returns error instead of panic when
  adapter created without surface. ([wgpu#107](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/issues/107))

- **GLES: match naga flattened binding indices** — GL binding = `group * 16 + binding`,
  matching naga GLSL output. Fixes SDF shapes invisible on GLES.

- **core: prefer GPU adapters over Software in RequestAdapter** — GPU adapters selected
  before CPU/Software. ForceFallbackAdapter correctly returns CPU. 3 tests.

### Dependencies

- naga v0.14.7 → v0.14.8 (GLSL bind group collision fix)

## [0.21.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **core: Binder struct for render/compute pass validation** — Tracks assigned vs expected
  bind group layouts per slot (matching Rust wgpu-core pattern). At draw/dispatch time,
  `checkCompatibility()` verifies all expected slots have compatible bind groups assigned.
  13 binder tests.

- **core: comprehensive render/compute pass state validation** — SetBindGroup validates
  MAX_BIND_GROUPS hard cap (8), pipeline bind group count, and dynamic offset alignment
  (256 bytes). Draw/DrawIndexed validate pipeline is set, vertex buffer count, and index
  buffer presence. Dispatch validates pipeline set + bind group compatibility.
  25+ new tests.

### Fixed

- **core: SetBindGroup index bounds validation** — Prevents `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets`
  crash on AMD/NVIDIA GPUs when bind group index exceeds pipeline layout set count.
  Intel silently tolerates this spec violation; AMD/NVIDIA crash with access violation.
  Fixes [ui#52](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/52).

## [0.21.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed

- **core: per-stage resource limit validation in CreateBindGroupLayout** — Validates
  storage buffer, uniform buffer, sampler, sampled texture, and storage texture counts
  per shader stage against device limits before calling HAL. Prevents wgpu-native abort
  when Vello compute requests 9 storage buffers on devices with limit 8. Error is now
  returned gracefully, enabling fallback to SDF renderer.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **public API: complete three-layer WebGPU stack** — The root `wgpu` package now
  provides a full typed API for GPU programming. All operations go through
  wgpu (public) → wgpu/core (validation) → wgpu/hal (backend). Consumers never
  need to import `wgpu/hal` for standard use.

- **public API: SetLogger / Logger** — `wgpu.SetLogger()` and `wgpu.Logger()`
  propagate the logger to the entire stack (API, core, HAL backends).

- **public API: Fence and async submission** — `Fence` type, `Device.CreateFence()`,
  `WaitForFence()`, `ResetFence()`, `GetFenceStatus()`, `FreeCommandBuffer()`.
  `Queue.SubmitWithFence()` for non-blocking GPU submission with fence signaling.

- **public API: Surface lifecycle** — `Surface.SetPrepareFrame()` for platform
  HiDPI/DPI hooks. `Surface.DiscardTexture()` for canceled frames. `Surface.HAL()`
  escape hatch. Delegates to `core.Surface` state machine.

- **public API: CommandEncoder extensions** — `CopyTextureToBuffer()`,
  `TransitionTextures()`, `DiscardEncoding()`. All use wgpu types (no hal in signatures).

- **public API: HAL accessors** — `Device.HalDevice()`, `Device.HalQueue()`,
  `Texture.HalTexture()`, `TextureView.HalTextureView()` for advanced interop.

- **public API: proper type definitions** — Replaced hal type aliases with proper
  structs: `Extent3D`, `Origin3D`, `ImageDataLayout`, `DepthStencilState`,
  `StencilFaceState`, `TextureBarrier`, `TextureRange`, `TextureUsageTransition`,
  `BufferTextureCopy`. Unexported `toHAL()` converters. No hal leakage in godoc.

- **core: complete resource types (CORE-001)** — All 12 stub resource types
  (Texture, Sampler, BindGroupLayout, PipelineLayout, BindGroup, ShaderModule,
  RenderPipeline, ComputePipeline, CommandEncoder, CommandBuffer, QuerySet, Surface)
  now have full struct definitions with HAL handle wrapping.

- **core: Surface state machine (CORE-002)** — Unconfigured → Configured → Acquired
  lifecycle with PrepareFrameFunc hook and auto-reconfigure on dimension changes.

- **core: CommandEncoder state machine (CORE-003)** — Recording/InRenderPass/
  InComputePass/Finished/Error states with validated transitions.

- **core: resource accessors (CORE-004)** — Read-only accessors and idempotent
  Destroy() for all resource types.

- **cmd/wgpu-triangle** — Single-threaded wgpu API triangle example.

- **cmd/wgpu-triangle-mt** — Multi-threaded wgpu API triangle example.

### Changed

- **Updated naga v0.14.6 → v0.14.7** — Fixes MSL sequential per-type binding
  indices across bind groups.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: validate WSI query functions in LoadInstance** — `vkGetPhysicalDevice-
  SurfaceCapabilitiesKHR`, `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR`, and
  `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR` are now verified during instance
  initialization. Previously, if any WSI function failed to load (returned nil),
  the error was silent until a later SIGSEGV via goffi nil function pointer call.
  Now fails fast with a clear error message.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Metal: missing stencil attachment in render pass** — `BeginRenderPass` configured
  only the depth attachment, completely skipping the stencil attachment. On Apple Silicon
  TBDR GPUs, this left the stencil load action as `MTLLoadActionDontCare`, causing
  undefined stencil values and progressive rendering artifacts on Retina displays.
  Now configures `rpDesc.stencilAttachment` with texture, load/store actions, and clear
  value — matching the Vulkan and DX12 backends.
  ([#171](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/171))

- **Metal: missing `setClearDepth:` call** — depth clear value was never explicitly set,
  relying on Metal's default of 1.0. Now calls `setClearDepth:` when `DepthLoadOp` is
  `LoadOpClear` for correctness.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Core validation layer** (VAL-002) — exhaustive spec-level validation before
  HAL calls. 7 validation functions in `core/validate.go` covering 30+ WebGPU
  rules for textures, samplers, shaders, pipelines, bind groups, and bind group
  layouts. Validates dimensions, limits, multisampling, formats, and usage flags.

- **Typed error types** (VAL-002) — 7 new typed errors with specific error kinds
  and context fields: `CreateTextureError` (13 kinds), `CreateSamplerError` (5),
  `CreateShaderModuleError` (3), `CreateRenderPipelineError` (8),
  `CreateComputePipelineError` (3), `CreateBindGroupLayoutError` (3),
  `CreateBindGroupError` (2). All support `errors.As()` for programmatic handling.

- **Deferred nil error detection** (VAL-003) — 10 pass encoder and command encoder
  methods that previously silently ignored nil inputs now record deferred errors
  following the WebGPU spec pattern. Errors surface at `End()` / `Finish()`:
  `RenderPass.SetPipeline`, `SetBindGroup`, `SetVertexBuffer`, `SetIndexBuffer`,
  `DrawIndirect`, `DrawIndexedIndirect`, `ComputePass.SetPipeline`, `SetBindGroup`,
  `DispatchIndirect`, `CommandEncoder.CopyBufferToBuffer`.

- **Format conversion tests** (COV-001) — 26 new test functions across Metal (20),
  Vulkan (4), DX12 (2), and GLES (5 format cases) backends.

### Fixed

- **5 nil panic paths** (VAL-001) — added nil checks in `CreateBindGroup` (nil layout),
  `CreatePipelineLayout` (nil bind group layout element), `Queue.Submit` (nil command
  buffer), `Surface.Configure` (nil device), `Surface.Present` (nil texture).

- **Metal: CopyDst buffer storage mode** — buffers with `CopyDst` usage were
  allocated with `StorageModePrivate` (GPU-only), causing "buffer not mappable"
  errors on Apple Silicon when `Queue.WriteBuffer()` tried to write. Now uses
  `StorageModeShared` for `CopyDst` and `MappedAtCreation` buffers, matching
  the Vulkan backend behavior. On UMA (all Apple Silicon) this is zero-cost.
  ([gg#170](https://github.com/gogpu/gg/issues/170))

- **Metal: staging buffer fallback for ReadBuffer/WriteBuffer** — defense-in-depth:
  if a buffer is `StorageModePrivate`, `WriteBuffer` and `ReadBuffer` now fall
  back to a temporary staging buffer + blit instead of failing. Mirrors the
  pattern already used by `WriteTexture` and matches Rust wgpu behavior.

- **Metal: zero-length data guard** — `WriteBuffer` and `ReadBuffer` now return
  early for empty data slices, preventing a potential panic in the staging path.

### Changed

- **HAL defense-in-depth** (VAL-004) — HAL nil checks now use `"BUG: ..."` prefix
  to signal core validation gaps. Removed 6 redundant spec checks (buffer size,
  texture dimensions) from Vulkan, Metal, DX12 — core validates these. Added 9
  missing nil checks to GLES, Software, and Noop backends.

### Dependencies

- **gputypes v0.2.0 → v0.3.0** — `TextureUsage.ContainsUnknownBits()` method,
  used by core validation for texture descriptor validation (VAL-002).

## [0.19.7] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Queue.WriteTexture** — public API for writing data to textures. Includes
  `ImageCopyTexture` descriptor, `ImageDataLayout` alias, and full nil validation
  with specific error messages.
  ([#95](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/pull/95) by [@Carmen-Shannon](https://github.com/Carmen-Shannon))

### Changed

- **Update naga v0.14.5 → v0.14.6** — MSL pass-through globals fix: helper
  functions now receive texture/sampler as extra parameters instead of using
  `[[binding]]` attributes. Fixes black screen on M3 Mac.
  ([naga#40](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/pull/40))

## [0.19.6] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Metal: MSAA resolve store action** — when a render pass has a resolve target
  (MSAA → single-sample), Metal requires `MTLStoreActionMultisampleResolve` or
  `MTLStoreActionStoreAndMultisampleResolve`. We were setting `MTLStoreActionStore`,
  causing Metal to silently skip the resolve. The surface texture stayed
  uninitialized (purple/magenta screen).
  ([ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

## [0.19.5] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Metal: add vertex descriptor to render pipeline creation** — Metal requires
  an explicit `MTLVertexDescriptor` when the vertex function has input attributes.
  Without it, pipeline creation fails with "Vertex function has input attributes
  but no vertex descriptor was set." Added `buildVertexDescriptor()` that maps
  WebGPU `VertexBufferLayout` to Metal vertex attributes and buffer layouts.
  ([ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

### Added

- **Complete Metal vertex format mapping** — all WebGPU vertex formats (8/16/32-bit
  int/uint/float, normalized, packed 10-10-10-2) now map to corresponding
  `MTLVertexFormat` constants.

### Changed

- **Update goffi v0.4.1 → v0.4.2**
- **Update naga v0.14.4 → v0.14.5**

## [0.19.4] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **Update goffi v0.3.9 → v0.4.1** — fix SIGSEGV on Linux/macOS for Vulkan
  functions with >6 arguments (`vkCmdPipelineBarrier`, etc.)
  ([goffi#19](https://github.com/go-webgpu/goffi/issues/19),
  [gogpu#119](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/119))

## [0.19.3] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- **Update naga v0.14.3 → v0.14.4** — MSL backend fixes: vertex `[[stage_in]]`
  for struct-typed arguments, `metal::discard_fragment()` namespace prefix
  ([naga#38](https://github.com/gogpu/naga/pull/38),
  [ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

## [0.19.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Metal: SIGBUS crash on Apple Silicon from ObjC block PAC re-signing** —
  ObjC blocks were constructed with `_NSConcreteStackBlock` but allocated on the
  Go heap. When Metal calls `Block_copy()` during `addCompletedHandler:`, ARM64e
  Pointer Authentication (PAC) re-signs the invoke function pointer. Since
  `ffi.NewCallback` pointers are unsigned, authentication fails and produces a
  corrupted pointer that causes SIGBUS ~0.7s after launch when Metal's completion
  queue invokes the callback. Fixed by switching to `_NSConcreteGlobalBlock` with
  `BLOCK_IS_GLOBAL` flag, which makes `Block_copy()` a complete no-op (no memmove,
  no PAC re-signing). Added `blockPinRegistry` to prevent GC collection of block
  literals while Metal holds references. Removed stale `runtime.KeepAlive(uintptr)`
  calls that were no-ops (GC doesn't track `uintptr` as roots).
  ([wgpu#89](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/issues/89),
  [ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

### Changed

- **CI: upgraded codecov-action v4 → v5**, added `codecov.yml` configuration
- **Tests: added coverage tests** for core, HAL backends, and format conversion

## [0.19.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Metal: crash on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) with depth/stencil textures** —
  `Depth24PlusStencil8` was hardcoded to `MTLPixelFormatDepth24UnormStencil8` (255),
  which is unsupported on Apple Silicon GPUs (only available on legacy AMD GPUs in
  Intel-era Macs). Metal rejected the invalid pixel format with SIGABRT. Additionally,
  `Depth24Plus` was completely missing from the format mapping, returning
  `MTLPixelFormatInvalid` (0). Fixed by detecting device capability via
  `isDepth24Stencil8PixelFormatSupported` at adapter enumeration and choosing
  `Depth32Float`/`Depth32FloatStencil8` (universally supported) when Depth24 is
  unavailable. Follows the same pattern as wgpu-rs (`wgpu-hal/src/metal/adapter.rs`).
  ([ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23))

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `hal.Queue.WriteBuffer` now returns `error`** — previously a silent void method
  that could swallow errors from all backends (Vulkan `FlushMappedMemoryRanges`, Metal/DX12
  buffer mapping, etc.). All 7 backend implementations (vulkan, metal, dx12, gles, gles_linux,
  software, noop) updated. All callers in tests and examples now check errors.
- **BREAKING: `hal.Queue.WriteTexture` now returns `error`** — previously a void method.
  All 7 backend implementations updated with proper error propagation from staging buffer
  allocation, data copy, and submission. Callers updated across the ecosystem.
- **BREAKING: `wgpu.Queue.WriteBuffer` now returns `error`** — public API wrapper updated
  to propagate errors from HAL layer.
- **BREAKING: `wgpu.Queue.WriteTexture` now returns `error`** — public API wrapper updated
  to propagate errors from HAL layer.

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: `WriteTexture` consumes swapchain acquire semaphore** — `WriteTexture` performs
  an internal staging `Submit()` that consumed the swapchain acquire semaphore meant for the
  render pass. This caused `vkQueueSubmit` to fail or produce undefined behavior when the
  render pass subsequently tried to use the already-consumed semaphore. Fixed by saving and
  restoring `activeSwapchain`/`acquireUsed` state around the staging submit, protected by mutex.
  ([gogpu#119](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/119))
- **Vulkan: `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` masked by void `WriteTexture`** — Vulkan staging submit
  errors were silently discarded because `WriteTexture` returned void. Now all Vulkan errors
  (buffer mapping, memory flush, queue submit) propagate to the caller.
- **Vulkan: `CmdSetBlendConstants` codegen regression** — auto-generated binding used scalar
  float signature instead of pointer-to-float-array. Vulkan ABI expects `const float[4]` as
  pointer, not scalar. Caused SIGSEGV in `BeginRenderPass` for any application using blend.
- **Noop: `WriteBuffer` rejects non-mapped buffers** — noop `CreateBuffer` returns `*Resource`
  (not `*Buffer`) for non-mapped buffers. `WriteBuffer` type assertion now handles both types.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: buffer-to-image copy row stride corruption** — `convertBufferImageCopyRegions` incorrectly
  inferred `bytesPerTexel` via integer division `BytesPerRow / Width` instead of using the texture
  format's known block size. When `BytesPerRow` was padded to 256-byte alignment, the division
  produced wrong results for most image widths (126 out of 204 possible widths for RGBA8).
  For example, width=204: `1024 / 204 = 5` (should be 4) → Vulkan received wrong `bufferRowLength`
  → pixel corruption on rounded rectangles and other non-power-of-2 width textures.
  Fixed by adding `blockCopySize()` static lookup matching the Rust wgpu reference implementation's
  `TextureFormat::block_copy_size()`. Covers all non-compressed WebGPU texture formats.
  ([gogpu#96](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/discussions/96))

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Public API root package** — `import "github.com/gogpu/wgpu"` provides a safe, ergonomic,
  WebGPU-spec-aligned API for third-party applications. Wraps `core/` and `hal/` into 20 public
  types: Instance, Adapter, Device, Queue, Buffer, Texture, TextureView, Sampler, ShaderModule,
  BindGroupLayout, PipelineLayout, BindGroup, RenderPipeline, ComputePipeline, CommandEncoder,
  CommandBuffer, RenderPassEncoder, ComputePassEncoder, Surface, SurfaceTexture.
  - `wgpu.CreateInstance()` → `instance.RequestAdapter()` → `adapter.RequestDevice()` flow
  - All `Create*` methods on Device with `(T, error)` returns
  - Synchronous `Queue.Submit()` with internal fence management
  - `Queue.WriteBuffer()` / `Queue.ReadBuffer()` for CPU↔GPU data transfer
  - Type aliases re-exported from `gputypes` (no need to import `gputypes` directly)
  - Deterministic cleanup via `Release()` on all resource types
  - Backend registration via blank import (`_ "github.com/gogpu/wgpu/hal/allbackends"`)
  - Full command recording: `RenderPassEncoder.SetPipeline/SetBindGroup`,
    `ComputePassEncoder.SetPipeline/SetBindGroup`, `CommandEncoder.CopyBufferToBuffer`
    delegate to HAL via new `RawPass()` / `RawEncoder()` core accessors
  - Examples rewritten to use public API (`examples/compute-copy/`, `examples/compute-sum/`)
  - Integration tests with software backend (15 tests covering full Instance→Submit flow)
  - `core/instance.go`: software backend now enumerated as real adapter (noop still skipped)

## [0.17.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Metal: MSAA texture view crash** — `CreateTextureView` crashed on Apple Silicon (M3) when
  creating a `TextureViewDimension2D` view from a multisampled (4x MSAA) source texture. Metal
  requires the view type to match the source texture's multisample state
  (`MTLTextureType2DMultisample`), unlike Vulkan which handles this implicitly.
  ([ui#23](https://github.com/gogpu/ui/issues/23), [#80](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/issues/80))

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Wayland Vulkan surface creation** — `CreateWaylandSurface()` method on Vulkan API for creating
  surfaces from `wl_display*` and `wl_surface*` C pointers via `VK_KHR_wayland_surface` extension.
  Function pointer `vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR` loaded via `vkGetInstanceProcAddr`, following the
  same pattern as X11, XCB, and Metal surface creation.

## [0.16.17] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: load platform surface creation functions** — `vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR`,
  `vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR`, `vkCreateWaylandSurfaceKHR`, and `vkCreateMetalSurfaceEXT` were never
  loaded via `GetInstanceProcAddr` — only `vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR` was. On Linux/macOS the
  function pointer stayed nil, and goffi FFI returned zeros (result=0, surface=0x0) instead of
  crashing, causing "null surface" errors downstream.
  ([gogpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/106))

## [0.16.16] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: X11/macOS surface creation pointer bug** — `CreateSurface` passed the Go stack address
  of the `display` parameter (`unsafe.Pointer(&display)`) instead of the actual `Display*` value
  (`unsafe.Pointer(display)`). This caused `vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR` to receive a Go stack pointer
  instead of the real Xlib `Display*`, resulting in null surfaces or SIGSEGV. Same fix applied to
  macOS `CAMetalLayer*` in the Vulkan-on-MoltenVK path.
  ([gogpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/106))

## [0.16.15] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- **Software backend: always compiled** — removed `//go:build software` build tags from all 34 files
  in `hal/software/`, `hal/software/raster/`, and `hal/software/shader/`. The software backend is now
  always available without `-tags software`. Pure Go, zero system dependencies — ideal for CI/CD,
  headless rendering, and fallback when no GPU is available.
  ([gogpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/106))

### Fixed

- **Software backend: nestif complexity** — extracted `clearDepthStencilAttachment()` helper in
  `RenderPassEncoder.End()` to reduce nesting depth (pre-existing issue exposed by build tag removal).

## [0.16.14] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: null surface handle guard** — `EnumerateAdapters`, `SurfaceCapabilities`, and
  `createSwapchain` now check for null `VkSurfaceKHR` handle before calling Vulkan surface
  functions. Prevents SIGSEGV on Linux when surface creation fails (e.g., X11 connection issues).
  ([gogpu#106](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/106))

### Changed

- **Dependencies:** naga v0.14.2 → v0.14.3 (5 SPIR-V compute shader bug fixes)

## [0.16.13] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: load VK_EXT_debug_utils via GetInstanceProcAddr** — `vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT`
  was loaded via `GetDeviceProcAddr`, which bypasses the validation layer's handle wrapping on
  NVIDIA drivers, causing `VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT-objectType-02590` ("Invalid
  VkDescriptorPool Object") errors. Now loaded via `GetInstanceProcAddr` as required for instance
  extensions. Also loads `vkCreateDebugUtilsMessengerEXT` and `vkDestroyDebugUtilsMessengerEXT`
  which were previously missing — debug messenger callback now works correctly.
  ([gogpu#98](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/98))

## [0.16.12] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: debug object naming** (VK-VAL-002) — added `setObjectName` helper that calls
  `vkSetDebugUtilsObjectNameEXT` after every Vulkan object creation. Labels buffers, textures,
  pipelines, render passes, framebuffers, descriptor pools, swapchain images, semaphores, and
  more with human-readable names. Eliminates false-positive `VUID-VkDebugUtilsObjectNameInfoEXT-objectType-02590`
  validation errors on NVIDIA where the validation layer's handle tracking lost sync with packed
  non-dispatchable handles. No-op when `VK_EXT_debug_utils` is unavailable. Resources display
  named labels in RenderDoc/Nsight captures.
  ([gogpu#98](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/98))

## [0.16.11] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: zero-extent swapchain on window minimize** (VK-VAL-001) — `createSwapchain()` used
  `capabilities.CurrentExtent` as primary extent source. NVIDIA drivers report `CurrentExtent = {0, 0}`
  when minimized, passing zero directly to `vkCreateSwapchainKHR` and violating
  `VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-imageExtent-01274`. Now uses `config` dimensions as primary source
  (matching Rust wgpu-hal `native.rs:189-197` pattern), with `CurrentExtent` only for clamping to
  the valid range. Returns `hal.ErrZeroArea` when clamped extent is zero.
  ([gogpu#98](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/98))

- **Vulkan: unconditional viewport/scissor in BeginRenderPass** — viewport and scissor dynamic state
  was conditionally set only when render dimensions > 0. When zero-extent frames slipped through,
  the pipeline's dynamic state was never initialized, causing `VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-07831` and
  `VUID-vkCmdDraw-None-07832` validation errors. Now always sets viewport/scissor using
  `max(dim, 1)` as safety net.
  ([gogpu#98](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/98))

### Changed

- **Public examples moved to `examples/`** — `compute-copy` and `compute-sum` moved from `cmd/` to
  `examples/` following Go project layout conventions. `cmd/` retains internal tools (vk-gen, backend tests).

## [0.16.10] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Vulkan: pre-acquire semaphore wait** (VK-IMPL-004) — Acquire semaphores are rotated across
  frames, but nothing guaranteed the GPU had consumed the previous wait before reuse, violating
  `VUID-vkAcquireNextImageKHR-semaphore-01779` on some drivers. Now tracks the submission fence
  value per acquire semaphore and waits before reuse, matching Rust wgpu's
  `previously_used_submission_index` pattern. Also adds binary fence pool tracking to
  `SubmitForPresent` which previously submitted with no fence at all.
  ([gogpu#98](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/98))

### Dependencies

- naga v0.14.1 → v0.14.2 (GLSL GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects fix, golden snapshot tests)

## [0.16.9] - 2026-02-21

### Dependencies

- naga v0.14.0 → v0.14.1 (HLSL row_major matrices for DX12, GLSL namedExpressions leak fix for GLES)

## [0.16.8] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Metal: blank window on macOS** ([gogpu#89](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/89)) —
  `Queue.Present()` only released the drawable reference without calling `presentDrawable:`.
  Now creates a dedicated command buffer for presentation matching the Rust wgpu pattern:
  `commandBuffer` → `presentDrawable:` → `commit`. Fixes blank rendering on macOS Tahoe M2 Max.

## [0.16.7] - 2026-02-21

### Dependencies

- naga v0.13.1 → v0.14.0 (Essential 15/15 reference shaders, 48 type aliases, 25 math ops, 20+ SPIR-V fixes)

## [0.16.6] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Metal backend debug logging** — 23 new `hal.Logger()` calls across the critical
  rendering path: `AcquireTexture`, `Submit`, `Present`, `BeginEncoding`/`EndEncoding`,
  `CreateCommandEncoder`, `Wait`/`WaitIdle`, `Destroy`, and all three ObjC block callback
  invocations (shared event, completion handler, frame completion). Enables diagnosis of
  blank window issues on macOS (gogpu/gogpu#89) and validates goffi callback delivery
  (go-webgpu/goffi#16). Metal backend now has ~38 log points, matching Vulkan/DX12 coverage.

### Changed

- **goffi** v0.3.8 → v0.3.9

## [0.16.5] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Vulkan per-encoder command pools** (VK-POOL-001) — Each `CreateCommandEncoder` now gets
  its own dedicated `VkCommandPool` + `VkCommandBuffer` pair, matching Rust wgpu-hal architecture.
  Eliminates race condition between per-frame bulk pool reset (`vkResetCommandPool`) and individual
  command buffer freeing (`vkFreeCommandBuffers`) that caused `vkBeginCommandBuffer(): Couldn't find
  VkCommandBuffer Object` access violation crashes. Pools are recycled via a thread-safe free list
  with lazy reset on next acquire. No API changes — `hal.Device` interface unchanged.

## [0.16.4] - 2026-02-18

Vulkan timeline semaphore fences, binary fence pool, hot-path allocation optimization,
and enterprise benchmarks. Internal performance improvements — no API changes.

### Added

- **Enterprise hot-path benchmarks** — 44+ benchmarks with `ReportAllocs()` covering Vulkan
  Submit/Present/Encoding cycle, descriptor operations, memory allocator, noop backend overhead,
  and cross-backend HAL interface. Table-driven sub-benchmarks for different sizes and workloads.
- **Compute shader SDF integration test** — End-to-end GPU test: WGSL SDF shader → naga compile →
  Vulkan compute pipeline → dispatch → ReadBuffer → CPU reference verification (256 pixels, ±0.01).
- **Compute shader examples** — `examples/compute-sum/` (parallel pairwise reduction) and
  `examples/compute-copy/` (scaled buffer copy) demonstrating the compute pipeline API.
- **Timestamp queries for compute passes** — `ComputePassTimestampWrites`, `CreateQuerySet`,
  `ResolveQuerySet` with full Vulkan implementation (`vkCmdWriteTimestamp`, `vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults`).
  Other backends return `ErrTimestampsNotSupported`.
- **Software backend compute error** — `ErrComputeNotSupported` sentinel error with `errors.Is` support.
- **Compute shader documentation** — `docs/compute-shaders.md` (getting started guide) and
  `docs/compute-backends.md` (backend support matrix).

### Changed

- **Vulkan timeline semaphore fence** (VK-IMPL-001) — Single `VkSemaphore` with monotonic `uint64`
  counter replaces binary `VkFence` ring buffer on Vulkan 1.2+. Signal attached to real
  `vkQueueSubmit` (eliminates empty submit per frame). Replaces transfer fence state machine.
  Graceful fallback to binary fences on pre-1.2 drivers. Based on Rust wgpu-hal `Fence::TimelineSemaphore`.
- **Vulkan command buffer batch allocation** (VK-IMPL-002) — Batch-allocate 16 command buffers
  per `vkAllocateCommandBuffers` call (matches wgpu-hal `ALLOCATION_GRANULARITY`). Free/used list
  recycling per frame slot. Handles are valid after `vkResetCommandPool` (flag 0).
- **Vulkan binary fence pool** (VK-IMPL-003) — `fencePool` with per-submission tracking for
  Vulkan <1.2 where timeline semaphores are unavailable. Active/free lists with non-blocking
  `maintain()` polling, `signal()` fence acquisition, `wait()` with watermark fast-path.
  Replaces 2-slot binary fence ring buffer and separate transfer fence. Mirrors Rust wgpu-hal
  `FencePool` pattern. `deviceFence` now always created (never nil) — unified dual-path dispatch.
- **Vulkan hot-path allocation reduction** — `sync.Pool` for CommandEncoder, CommandBuffer,
  ComputePassEncoder, RenderPassEncoder. Stack-allocated `[3]vk.ClearValue` in BeginRenderPass.
  Removed CommandPool wrapper struct. Per-frame Submit uses pooled `[]vk.CommandBuffer` slices.
  Result: BeginEndEncoding 15→13 allocs, ComputePassBeginEnd 25→22 allocs, EncodeSubmitCycle 28→26 allocs.

### Fixed

- **Vulkan transfer fence race condition** — `Submit()` now waits for previous GPU work before
  resetting transfer fence, preventing "vkResetFences: pFences[0] is in use" validation error.
- **Vulkan swapchain image view leak** — `createSwapchain()` now calls `destroyResources()`
  (semaphores + image views) instead of `releaseSyncResources()` (semaphores only) when
  reconfiguring, preventing "VkImageView has not been destroyed" validation errors on shutdown.
- **Vulkan device destroy fence wait** — `Destroy()` waits for all in-flight frame slots
  before destroying fences, preventing fence-in-use errors during cleanup.

## [0.16.3] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **`hal.Device.WaitIdle()` interface method** — Waits for all GPU work to complete before
  resource destruction. Implemented across all backends: Vulkan (`vkDeviceWaitIdle`),
  DX12 (`waitForGPU`), Metal (`waitUntilCompleted`), GLES (`glFinish`), noop/software (no-op).

### Fixed

- **Vulkan per-frame fence tracking** — Replaced single shared `frameFence` with per-slot
  `VkFence` objects (one per frame-in-flight). Each fence is only reset after `vkWaitForFences`
  confirms it is signaled. Fixes `vkResetFences(): pFences[0] is in use` validation error.
  Frame fence signaling moved from `Submit()` to `Present()` to avoid fence reuse across
  multiple submits per frame. Pattern based on Rust wgpu-hal FencePool design.

- **DX12 per-frame fence tracking** — Per-frame command allocator pool with timeline fence.
  `advanceFrame()` waits only for the specific old frame slot instead of all GPU work.
  Eliminates two `waitForGPU()` stalls per frame (in `BeginEncoding` and `Present`).

- **Metal per-frame fence tracking** — `maxFramesInFlight` semaphore (capacity 2) limits
  CPU-ahead-of-GPU buffering. `frameCompletionHandler` signals semaphore on GPU completion.
  Event-based `Wait()` replaces polling loop. Async `WriteTexture` via staging buffer and
  blit encoder.

- **GLES VSync on Windows** — Load `wglSwapIntervalEXT` via `wglGetProcAddress` during
  `Surface.Configure()`. Maps `PresentMode` to swap interval: Fifo=1 (VSync on),
  Immediate=0 (VSync off). Fixes 100% GPU usage on the GLES Windows backend.

## [0.16.2] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **Metal autorelease pool LIFO violation** — Replaced stored autorelease pools with
  scoped pools that drain immediately within the same function. Previously, pools were
  stored in `CommandBuffer` structs and drained asynchronously via `FencePool`, causing
  LIFO violations when frame N+1 overlapped with frame N on the ObjC pool stack.
  macOS Tahoe (26.2) upgraded this from a warning to fatal SIGABRT. Fix matches the
  Rust wgpu-hal Metal backend pattern. Fixes gogpu/gogpu#83.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- **Vulkan framebuffer cache invalidation** — `DestroyTextureView` now invalidates
  cached framebuffers before calling `vkDestroyImageView`, ensuring framebuffers that
  reference the view are destroyed first. Fixes Vulkan validation error:
  `vkDestroyImageView`/`vkDestroyFramebuffer` in use by `VkCommandBuffer`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-15

Major release: full GLES rendering pipeline, structured logging across all backends,
MSAA support, and cross-backend stability fixes.

### Added

#### Structured Logging
- **`log/slog` integration** — All HAL backends now emit structured diagnostic logs
  via Go's standard `log/slog` package. Silent by default; enable with
  `slog.SetLogLoggerLevel(slog.LevelDebug)` or a custom handler. Zero overhead
  when logging is disabled.

#### OpenGL ES Backend (Full Rendering Pipeline)
- **WGSL-to-GLSL shader compilation** — End-to-end shader pipeline via naga:
  WGSL source is compiled to GLSL, then loaded via `glShaderSource`/`glCompileShader`.
  Includes VAO creation, FBO setup, and triangle rendering.
- **Offscreen FBO and MSAA textures** — Framebuffer objects for off-screen rendering,
  multi-sample texture support, and `CopyTextureToBuffer` readback path.
- **Vertex attributes, stencil state, color mask** — Full vertex attribute layout
  configuration, stencil test state, per-channel color write masks, and BGRA readback
  format conversion.
- **VAO, viewport, blend state, bind group commands** — Vertex Array Objects,
  viewport/scissor state, blend equation/factor configuration, and bind group
  resource binding.

#### Metal Backend
- **SetBindGroup** — Bind group resource binding for render and compute encoders.
- **WriteTexture** — GPU texture upload via staging buffer and blit encoder.
- **Fence synchronization** — CPU-GPU synchronization for command completion.

#### DX12 Backend
- **CreateBindGroup** — Bind group creation with SRV/CBV/sampler descriptor
  mapping to root parameter slots.
- **InfoQueue debug messages** — `ID3D12InfoQueue` captures validation
  errors/warnings when debug layer is enabled. `DrainDebugMessages()` reads
  and logs all pending messages after Submit and Present.

#### Vulkan Backend
- **MSAA render pass support** — Multi-sample render pass with automatic resolve
  attachment configuration. Includes depth/stencil usage flag fixes for MSAA targets.

### Fixed

#### DX12 Backend
- **GPU hang causing DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION BSOD** — Resolved a device hang that
  triggered a Windows kernel watchdog timeout on some hardware configurations.
- **Texture resource state tracking** — Correct resource barriers via per-texture
  state tracking. Fixes rendering corruption from missing or incorrect
  COMMON/COPY_DEST/SHADER_RESOURCE transitions. Also fixes a COM reference leak.
- **MSAA resolve, view dimensions, descriptor recycling** — MSAA resolve copies
  now target the correct subresource. Texture view dimensions match the underlying
  resource. Descriptor recycling frees slots from the correct staging heaps.
- **Readback pitch alignment and barrier states** — Buffer readback row pitch is
  now aligned to D3D12_TEXTURE_DATA_PITCH_ALIGNMENT (256 bytes). Resource barriers
  use correct before/after states for copy operations.
- **Staging descriptor heaps** — SRV and sampler descriptors are now created in
  non-shader-visible staging heaps, then copied to shader-visible heaps via
  `CopyDescriptorsSimple`. Follows the DX12 specification requirement that
  `CopyDescriptorsSimple` source must be non-shader-visible. Prevents subtle
  rendering corruption on some hardware.
- **Descriptor recycling** — `TextureView.Destroy()` and `Sampler.Destroy()` now
  free descriptors from the correct staging heaps, enabling proper slot reuse.

#### Vulkan Backend
- **Descriptor pool allocation** — Always include all descriptor types (uniform buffer,
  storage buffer, sampled image, sampler, storage image) in pool creation. Fixes
  `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_POOL_MEMORY` when bind groups reference previously unused types.
- **vkCmdSetBlendConstants FFI signature** — Corrected goffi calling convention to
  pass blend constants by pointer, matching the Vulkan specification.
- **Dynamic pipeline states** — All 4 dynamic states (viewport, scissor, stencil
  reference, blend constants) are now declared on every render pipeline. Prevents
  validation errors on drivers that require complete dynamic state declarations.

#### Metal Backend
- **Command buffer creation deferred to BeginEncoding** — `CreateCommandEncoder`
  eagerly created a Metal command buffer, conflicting with `BeginEncoding`'s guard
  (`cmdBuffer != 0`). Every `BeginEncoding` call returned "already recording" error,
  and the pre-allocated command buffer + autorelease pool were never released.
  At 60fps this leaked ~30GB in minutes. Fix: defer command buffer creation to
  `BeginEncoding`, matching the two-step pattern used by Vulkan and DX12 backends.
  (Fixes [#55])

#### GLES Backend
- **Surface resolve** — Correct resolve blit from MSAA renderbuffer to single-sample
  surface texture for presentation.

### Changed

- **Metal queue** — Eliminated `go vet` unsafe.Pointer warnings by using typed
  wrapper functions for Objective-C message sends.
- **DX12 descriptor heap management** — Free list recycling for descriptor slots,
  reducing allocation overhead for long-running applications.
- **naga v0.12.0 → v0.13.0** — GLSL backend improvements, HLSL/SPIR-V fixes

## [0.15.1] - 2026-02-13

Critical fixes across DX12, Metal, and Vulkan backends.

### Fixed

- **DX12 WriteBuffer** was a no-op stub, causing blank renders with uniform data
  - Staging buffer + `CopyBufferRegion` for DEFAULT heap (GPU-only) buffers
  - Direct CPU mapping for UPLOAD heap buffers (zero-copy path)
  - D3D12 auto-promotion from COMMON state for buffer copies
- **DX12 WriteTexture** was a no-op stub, textures never uploaded to GPU
  - Staging buffer + `CopyTextureRegion` with 256-byte row pitch alignment
  - Resource barriers: COMMON → COPY_DEST → SHADER_RESOURCE
- **DX12 shader compilation** produced empty DXBC bytecode
  - Added `d3dcompile` package — Pure Go bindings to d3dcompiler_47.dll
  - Wired `compileWGSLModule`: WGSL → naga HLSL → D3DCompile → DXBC
- **Metal memory leak** — 30GB+ memory usage on macOS (Issue #55)
  - `FreeCommandBuffer` was a no-op — command buffers never released after submit
  - NSString labels leaked in `BeginEncoding`, `BeginComputePass`, `CreateBuffer`, `CreateTexture`

### Added

- **Vulkan debug messenger** — validation errors now logged via `log.Printf` (Issue #53)
  - `VK_EXT_debug_utils` messenger created when `InstanceFlagsDebug` is set
  - Captures ERROR and WARNING severity from validation layers
  - Cross-platform callback via `goffi/ffi.NewCallback`
  - Zero overhead when debug mode is off

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-10

HAL Queue ReadBuffer for GPU→CPU data transfer, enabling compute shader result readback.

### Added

#### HAL Interface
- **`ReadBuffer`** on `Queue` interface — GPU→CPU buffer readback for storage/staging buffers
  - Maps buffer memory, copies data to Go byte slice, unmaps
  - Enables compute shader pipelines (e.g., SDF rendering) to read results back to CPU
  - Implemented in Vulkan backend via `vkMapMemory`/`vkUnmapMemory`

### Changed

- **naga** dependency updated v0.11.1 → v0.12.0 — adds `OpFunctionCall`, compute shader codegen fixes
- **golang.org/x/sys** updated v0.39.0 → v0.41.0

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-09

Debug toolkit for GPU resource management and error handling.

### Added

#### Debug & Diagnostics (`core/`)
- **GPU Resource Leak Detection** — Track unreleased GPU resources at runtime
  - `SetDebugMode(true)` enables tracking with zero overhead when disabled (~1ns atomic load)
  - `ReportLeaks()` returns `LeakReport` with per-type counts (Buffer, Texture, Device, etc.)
  - `ResetLeakTracker()` for test cleanup
  - Integrated into Device, Buffer, Instance, CommandEncoder lifecycle
- **W3C WebGPU Error Scopes** — Programmatic GPU error capture per the WebGPU spec
  - `ErrorScopeManager` with LIFO stack-based scopes
  - `ErrorFilter`: Validation, OutOfMemory, Internal
  - `GPUError` type implementing Go `error` interface
  - Device integration: `device.PushErrorScope()`, `device.PopErrorScope()`
  - Lazy initialization, thread-safe via internal mutex
- **Thread Safety Tests** — Concurrent access validation
  - Concurrent leak tracking (track/untrack from 50+ goroutines)
  - Concurrent error scope operations (push/pop/report)
  - Concurrent instance creation and adapter requests

### Changed

- **naga** dependency updated v0.11.0 → v0.11.1 — fixes SPIR-V OpLogicalAnd, comparison/shift opcodes, variable initializers, runtime-sized arrays

## [0.13.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Render pass InitialLayout for LoadOpLoad** — Set correct `InitialLayout` when `LoadOp` is `Load` instead of unconditional `ImageLayoutUndefined`. Previously, Vulkan was allowed to discard image contents between render passes, causing ClearColor output to be lost (black background instead of the expected color). Affects both color and depth/stencil attachments.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-01

Major HAL interface additions: format capabilities, array textures, and render bundles.

### Added

#### Format & Surface Capabilities
- **GetTextureFormatCapabilities** — Query actual Vulkan format capabilities
  - Returns TextureFormatCapabilityFlags based on `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties`
  - No more hardcoded flags — real hardware support detection
- **GetSurfaceCapabilities** — Query surface capabilities from Vulkan
  - Uses `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR` and `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR`
  - Returns real supported formats, present modes, and alpha modes

#### Array Textures & Cubemaps

  - Enables integration with external graphics libraries

### Fixed

- **Vulkan texture rendering** — Critical BufferRowLength fix
  - `BufferRowLength` now correctly specified in **texels**, not bytes

  - Root cause: Vulkan `VkBufferImageCopy` expects texel count, not byte count

- **WriteBuffer support** — Buffer memory mapping implementation
  - Proper staging buffer creation and memory mapping
  - Fixes texture upload pipeline

### Changed

- **Vulkan pipeline creation** — Code cleanup and refactoring
- **Update naga v0.8.4 → v0.9.0** — Sampler types, swizzle, SPIR-V fixes

## [0.11.2] - 2026-01-29

  - All enum values now match official WebGPU C header specification
  - Binary compatibility with wgpu-native and other WebGPU implementations

### Fixed

- **CompositeAlphaMode naming** — Fixed `PreMultiplied` → `Premultiplied` in all HAL adapters
  - Matches webgpu.h spec naming convention
  - Affected: Vulkan, DX12, GLES, Metal, Noop, Software adapters

## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-29

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `types/` package** — Use `github.com/gogpu/gputypes` instead
  - All WebGPU types now come from shared `gputypes` package
  - Import `github.com/gogpu/gputypes` for TextureFormat, BufferUsage, etc.
  - 1,745 lines removed, unified ecosystem types

### Changed

  - `hal.PresentMode` = `gputypes.PresentMode`
  - `hal.CompositeAlphaMode` = `gputypes.CompositeAlphaMode`
- 97 files updated for consistent type usage

### Migration

```go
// Before (wgpu v0.10.x)
import "github.com/gogpu/wgpu/types"
types.TextureFormatRGBA8Unorm

// After (wgpu v0.11.1)
import "github.com/gogpu/gputypes"
gputypes.TextureFormatRGBA8Unorm
```

## [0.10.3] - 2026-01-28

Enterprise-level multi-thread architecture for window responsiveness.

### Added

#### Internal
- **Thread Package** (`internal/thread/`) — Cross-platform thread abstraction
  - `Thread` — Dedicated OS thread with `runtime.LockOSThread()` for GPU operations
  - `RenderLoop` — Manages UI/render thread separation with deferred resize
  - `Call()`, `CallVoid()`, `CallAsync()` — Sync/async thread communication
  - `RequestResize()` / `ConsumePendingResize()` — Thread-safe resize coordination
  - Comprehensive tests (`thread_test.go`)

#### Vulkan Triangle Demo
- **Multi-Thread Architecture** — Ebiten-style separation for responsive windows
  - Main thread: Win32 message pump only (`runtime.LockOSThread()` in `init()`)
  - Render thread: All GPU operations including `vkDeviceWaitIdle`
  - Deferred swapchain resize: size captured in WM_SIZE, applied on render thread
  - No more "Not Responding" during resize/drag operations

#### Windows Platform
- **WM_SETCURSOR Handling** — Proper cursor restoration after resize
  - Fixes resize cursor staying 5-10 seconds after resize ends
  - Arrow cursor explicitly set when mouse enters client area

### Changed

#### HAL/Vulkan
- Removed unused fence wrapper functions from `swapchain.go`
  - `vkCreateFenceSwapchain`, `vkDestroyFenceSwapchain`
  - `vkWaitForFencesSwapchain`, `vkResetFencesSwapchain`
  - `vkGetFenceStatusSwapchain`

### Architecture

The multi-thread pattern follows Ebiten/Gio best practices:

```
Main Thread (OS Thread 0)     Render Thread (Dedicated)
├─ runtime.LockOSThread()     ├─ runtime.LockOSThread()
├─ Win32 Message Pump         ├─ Vulkan Device Operations
├─ WM_SIZE → RequestResize()  ├─ ConsumePendingResize()
└─ PollEvents()               ├─ vkDeviceWaitIdle (non-blocking UI!)
                              └─ Acquire → Render → Present
```

This architecture ensures:
- Window remains responsive during GPU operations
- Swapchain recreation doesn't freeze UI
- Proper handling of modal resize loops (WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE/WM_EXITSIZEMOVE)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

- **goffi v0.3.8** — Fixed CGO build tag consistency ([#43](https://github.com/gogpu/wgpu/issues/43))
  - Clear error message when building with CGO enabled: `undefined: GOFFI_REQUIRES_CGO_ENABLED_0`
  - Consistent `!cgo` build tags across all FFI files
  - See [goffi v0.3.8 release notes](https://github.com/go-webgpu/goffi/releases/tag/v0.3.8)

## [0.10.1] - 2026-01-16

Window responsiveness fix for Vulkan swapchain.

### Added

#### HAL
- **ErrNotReady Error** — New error for non-blocking acquire signaling
  - Returned when swapchain image is not ready yet
  - Signals caller to skip frame without error

### Changed

#### HAL/Vulkan
- **Non-blocking swapchain acquire** — Improved window responsiveness
  - Use 16ms timeout instead of infinite wait in `acquireNextImage()`
  - Return `ErrNotReady` on timeout instead of blocking forever
  - Don't advance semaphore rotation on timeout (matches wgpu-hal pattern)
  - Based on wgpu-hal `vulkan/swapchain/native.rs` implementation

### Fixed
- Window lag during resize/drag operations on Windows
- "Not responding" window state during GPU-bound rendering

  - Added `SetDrawable()` method to CommandBuffer for drawable attachment
  - Added `Drawable()` accessor to SurfaceTexture

- **Metal TextureView NSRange Parameters**

## [0.8.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **DX12 COM Calling Convention Bug** — Fixes device operations on Intel GPUs
  - Root cause: D3D12 methods returning structs require `this` pointer first, output pointer second
  - Affected methods: `GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart`, `GetGPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart`,
    `GetDesc` (multiple types), `GetResourceAllocationInfo`
  - Reference: [D3D12 Struct Return Convention](https://joshstaiger.org/notes/C-Language-Problems-in-Direct3D-12-GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart.html)

- **Vulkan goffi Argument Passing Bug** — Fixes Windows crash (Exception 0xc0000005)
  - Root cause: vk-gen generated incorrect FFI calls after syscall→goffi migration
  - Before: `unsafe.Pointer(ptr)` passed pointer value directly
  - After: `unsafe.Pointer(&ptr)` passes pointer TO pointer (goffi requirement)
  - Affected all Vulkan functions with pointer parameters

### Added

  - Follows wgpu-rs pattern where `Option<CommandBuffer>` presence indicates state
  - Added `IsRecording()` method for explicit state checking

### Changed
- Updated `github.com/gogpu/naga` dependency from v0.5.0 to v0.6.0

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-26

### Added

  - Matches wgpu-core `ConfigureSurfaceError::ZeroArea` pattern
  - Comprehensive unit tests in `hal/error_test.go`

### Fixed
- **macOS Zero Dimension Crash** — Fixes Issue [#20](https://github.com/gogpu/gogpu/issues/20)
  - Added zero-dimension validation to all `Surface.Configure()` implementations
  - Returns `ErrZeroArea` when width or height is zero
  - Affected backends: Metal, Vulkan, GLES (Linux/Windows), Software
  - Follows wgpu-core pattern: "Wait to recreate the Surface until the window has non-zero area"
